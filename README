Executable Programs (matches lab spec):

- textVectorizer.py
    Usage: python textVectorizer.py <dataset_root> <output_vectors> <output_ground_truth> [stopwords_list (1/2/3)] [stem (TRUE/FALSE)] [min_df]
- knnAuthorship.py
    Usage: python knnAuthorship.py <vectors_json> <ground_truth_csv> <similarity_metric: cosine/okapi> <k> [output_predictions]
- classifierEvaluation.py
    Usage: python classifierEvaluation.py <predictions_csv> <ground_truth_csv> [confusion_matrix_output_csv]
- KMeansAuthorship.py
    Usage: python KMeansAuthorship.py <vectors_json> <num_clusters> [max_iter] [output_file]
- clusteringEvaluation.py
    Usage: python clusteringEvaluation.py <clusters_csv> <ground_truth_csv>

---

There is no additional code. We reused our functions for building confusion matrices, but did not include any other reused code.

---

Output Files:

The confusion matrix is in confusion_matrix.csv,
the kmeans clustering results are in kmeans_clusters.csv, the knn predictions are in knn_predictions.csv,
the tf-idf vectors are in output_vectors.json/.txt, and the ground truth is in output_ground_truth.csv.

---

Instructions to run:
1. Make sure the C50 dataset is in the working directory under the folders ./C50train/ and ./C50test/.
2. Run textVectorizer.py to generate the tf-idf vectors and ground truth file (using stopword removal with either 1/2/3--indicating short medium or long--and stemming either TRUE/FALSE).
3. Execute the supervised method with knnAuthorship.py and evaluate using classifierEvaluation.py.
4. Execute the unsupervised method with KMeansAuthorship.py (50 clusters, 300 max iterations) and evaluate using clusteringEvaluation.py.
